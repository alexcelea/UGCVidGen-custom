1,"My bf (26M) and I (25F) fight constantly over his lack of communication, so I finally stopped caring...now he's upset that I'm not trying anymore","I've spent 2 years fighting with my boyfriend over his lack of communication in our long distance relationship. I was always the one who made an effort to keep us connected, even though I'm super busy managing my family business, working part time, AND studying medicine. He's ""too busy"" to text me back or update me about his day.\n\nThere was this one weekend where he missed our scheduled call because he was working on a project with friends. He didn't update me all day, then messaged me past midnight saying he was tired from work. I got really annoyed and told him it doesn't take an hour to send a message. I ended up blocking him out of frustration (I know that was wrong).\n\nThe next day I unblocked him, but I didn't message him like I normally would. I decided to stop prioritizing him in my mental to-do list. I wanted to lower my expectations and the pressure to communicate constantly. When he finally messaged me, he accused me of being petty and ""getting back at him."" I explained I wasn't bothered anymore because I made adjustments on my side.\n\nNow, weeks later, something weird is happening. He's talking more while I'm talking less. He's getting annoyed that I'm not making the same effort I used to. I tried going back to my old ways of messaging him all the time, but it just feels exhausting now. The thing is, I'm actually more comfortable with this new dynamic where I'm not constantly chasing him for attention.\n\nI don't know what to do now. Is it wrong that I've stopped putting in so much effort? Should I go back to being the one who carries our communication, or is this a sign we're just not compatible?",pexels stock negative mixed solo,instrumental mellow
