1,"My LDR boyfriend suddenly hates that I matched his energy","I (25F) reached my breaking point after 2 years of communication problems with my partner (26M) in our LDR. He rarely updates me, claims he's too busy, and often misses scheduled calls. I'm busy too with work, studying medicine and managing my family business, but I still managed to message him because it takes a minute.\nOne weekend was the last straw. He slept at his friend's house for a project and didn't update me until past midnight. When I expressed my annoyance, he just said he was busy. I blocked him out of frustration (which I know was wrong). The next day, I unblocked him but didn't message him - I decided to stop making him a priority since I'm tired of putting in all the effort.\nHe messaged me that evening saying I was being petty. I explained I wasn't bothered anymore because I'd made ""adjustments"" on my side - basically lowering my expectations and pressure on communication. He admitted his mistakes and apologized.\nFast forward a few weeks and things have changed completely. He's talking more while I'm talking less, and now HE'S getting annoyed. I tried going back to my old communication style but it feels exhausting. The weird thing is, I'm actually more comfortable with this new dynamic.\nI don't know what to do now. Is it wrong that I've stopped putting in so much effort? Should I force myself back to constantly initiating conversations just to make him happy, or is this new balance actually healthier for me?",px_negative_f_solo,instrumental_mellow
