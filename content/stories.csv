1,"My bf never updates me so I stopped messaging him... now he's mad","I stopped trying to communicate with my bf (26) after 2 years of begging him to text me more in our LDR. Now that I've given up, he's suddenly messaging more and getting annoyed that I'm not responding like I used to.\nEvery fight we have is about communication. He's ""too busy"" to message me, misses scheduled calls, and even when we're together on dates, he's glued to his phone. I'm juggling med school, family business, and work - yet I always made time for him. At least until now.\nLast month, he missed our weekend call for a project, didn't update me for hours, then got mad when I was upset. That was my breaking point. Instead of asking him to do better (again), I just... stopped caring. I took him off my mental priority list and focused on myself.\nNow the tables have turned. He's messaging more, apologizing, and trying harder - but I'm actually more comfortable with this low-contact situation. It's peaceful not constantly waiting for messages that never come.\nI don't know if I should try going back to my old communication style just because he's finally stepping up. Am I wrong for feeling more at peace with caring less?","px_negative_f_solo","instrumental_mellow"
2,"My GF leaves me on read during intimate conversations - should I be worried?","I'm struggling with my first real relationship and need advice on whether I'm being overly anxious or if these are real red flags.\nDuring an intimate text conversation while I was on vacation, she suddenly stopped responding. Hours later, she claimed she fell asleep, but I saw her post on Facebook in between. When I confronted her about it, she got defensive and said she's ""tired of feeling like she never does anything right.""\nThe communication issues don't stop there. When we try to make plans, she never offers alternatives if she can't make it. When I asked her to let me know her schedule in advance, she said ""I don't want to commit to you because I know that makes you angry when my schedule changes."" But I've only gotten upset once, two months ago, when she cancelled an hour before our plans.\nWe haven't really talked for the past few days. I've been working on my anxiety and insecurity through therapy, medication, and meditation, but her recent behavior is making me spiral back into old thought patterns. Is this just who she is, or is she losing interest? I want to make things work, but how can we have a future if we can't even communicate?","px_negative_mf_couple","instrumental_mellow"
3,"My LDR boyfriend never texts first - is he just not that into me?","I'm in a long distance relationship and struggling with our different communication styles. I like regular texting throughout the day and catching up on calls every few days, but my boyfriend sees things completely differently.\n""He says we already know what the other person is doing"" and sometimes ""just doesn't have anything to say."" I get that everyone's different, but it hurts when I'm always the one initiating conversations.\nWhen I try to wait for him to reach out first, it can take an entire day before I hear anything. I've talked to him about this multiple times, and he always says he'll work on it, but nothing ever changes.\nI'm starting to wonder if this is just who he is, or if he's just not that invested in our relationship. When you're apart, isn't communication supposed to be the foundation that keeps you connected?","px_negative_f_solo","instrumental_mellow"
4,"My boyfriend refuses to communicate during arguments - should I give up?","I'm devastated because my boyfriend of 3 years completely shuts down whenever I try to discuss our relationship problems. When I express any concerns, he goes silent and needs days to process - if he responds at all.\nI've tried everything to accommodate his communication style. I give him space, ask if he's ready to talk before bringing up sensitive topics, and only request simple acknowledgments like ""I hear you"" or ""I'm sorry this affected you."" But 9 times out of 10, I'm met with silence or deflection.\nWhen he does say hurtful things during arguments, he refuses to take accountability. Instead, he blames me for ""pushing his boundaries"" and ends conversations on his terms. He claims he shows love by working hard for our future, but doesn't understand that I need emotional support too.\nThe worst part? He rarely follows up after conflicts. He says he's ""sick of talking"" and we should just ""see how things go."" But how can we build a future together if he won't even discuss our problems? I'm starting to wonder if couples with such different communication styles can ever make it work.","px_negative_f_solo","instrumental_mellow"
