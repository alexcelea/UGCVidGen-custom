1,,"I matched my boyfriend's energy in our LDR and now he's mad that I communicate like him üòè\nFor 2 years, my bf (26M) barely messages me in our long-distance relationship. He's ""too busy"" to update me, misses scheduled calls, and even uses his phone during our rare in-person dates. I've begged him countless times to communicate better.\nLast month, he missed another weekend call for a project, didn't update me all day, then messaged past midnight saying he was ""just busy."" That was my breaking point.\nInstead of fighting about it again, I decided to match his energy. I stopped making him a priority in my daily mental checklist. No more constant updates or trying to maintain conversation. I just...existed.\nNow he's messaging more while I'm talking less, and guess what? He's getting annoyed! But honestly? I'm more comfortable this way. It's exhausting trying to force someone to communicate.\nHas anyone else stopped pushing for communication in their relationship? How do you know when to give up vs keep trying? ü§î",urban,reflective
